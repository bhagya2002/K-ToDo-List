# To-Do List

- This is my online ToDo List project
- It is my first code that contains PHP and MySQL

+ it consists of a login and register page where a user can create an account
+ they can then login to a view and logout page
+ the view page takes to the user's board of current To-Do's in the order of closest due date
+ the main page consists of date, clock, and weather widgets
+ you can add, remove, and see more information on the To-Do

## K ToDo List

The purpose of this project is to create an online task/assignment management system to learn and implement PHP alongside MySQL. For this project I used Apache and XAMPP to run a localhost which stored data on PHPMyAdmin. 

### Languages/Tools Used
- The main compenent of the program was written in PHP and MySQL which was used to create a login system which would make this a more personalized project for each user. This meant information was stored seperately for each user and could be created, read, updated, and deleted. User data was stored on PHPMyAdmin which consisted of login details, user tasks/assignments (due dates, extra information, category, etc.)</br>
- HTML5 was used to create the webpage and CSS3 was used to style it. Materialize, a CSS library often used by Google was also used in this project.</br>
- JavaScript was used to for addons/extensions after logging in.</br>


### Basic Layout
+ it consists of a login and register page where a user can create an account or login into a previously made account</br>
+ they can then go to a view page or logout</br>
+ the view page takes to the user's board of current To-Do's in the order of closest due date</br>
+ the view page consists of date, clock, and weather widgets</br>
+ you can create, read, update, and delete the To-Do's</br>
